Instructions for submitting code and documentation for the homework (16 Sep 2016):

1) To submit your homeworks you must authenticate using your LABINF account through one of the following methods:
- Using FTP from the web interface at this address:  https://www.labinf.polito.it/net2ftp
- Using any FTPS-able client, like Filezilla, connecting to this server:   ftp.labinf.polito.it
NOTICE: In both cases you will be asked to accept a Digital Certificate.

2) Your works must be submitted each as a single zip file containing everything (source code, executable and any
additional file that you find that could be of interest).
The archive must be named mpbs1.zip for the first work, mpbs2.zip for
the second work and mpbs3.zip for the third work and must be placed at
the top (base) directory. Please note that the system is case sensitive!
This means that at the end of upload in your home directory you will have
three files mpbs1.zip, mpbs2.zip and mpbs3.zip.

3) Deadline is by h.19 of Nov 18th for the first work, Dec 16th for the second work and Jan 20th for the third work. The files will be
automatically collected by a daemon just after deadline.
